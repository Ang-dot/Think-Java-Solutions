/**
 * Exercise 7-5 of think Java, page 101-102.
 * Infinite series expansion problem.
 * 
 * The book begins using factorial as the denominator of the terms, but it is changed to (denom*i)
 * in the loop because it is not as memory intensive as calling the factorial method.
 * 
 * Also, the use of Math.pow is eliminated and instead x is multiplied with itself (using ansX as x)
 * in order to make the equation more efficient.
 * 
 * Also, the first two terms of the equation added together is simply (1 + x/1). 
 * I have added this to the variable ans. This is why the loop begins at 2 (i.e. why i is set to 2).
